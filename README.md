# CyberCar
This project is for my Audi A6 (C5) 2004. But I'm trying to make it compatible with as many different cars as possible.
Some of ideas:

1. Connect to CAN bus and read/write to it.

2. GPS tracking

3. Connection to internet via WiFi and mobile connection.

4. Multimedia sub-project (as for now - RPi + Pioneer AVH-X7500BT via AV cable)
